/*
 *  This Program is designed to deal with the (second) optional form of
 *  5.2 Exercise, which required to generate a number between
 *  a random range. Then ask the user to guess the accurate number generated.
 *  In addition, the program will tell the user extra information of the number.
 *  And the game will work for 4 times in total. After the whole process, 
 *  the program is required not to tell you the best score you have made during the game.
